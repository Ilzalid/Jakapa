    <p>This is the Peer Evaluation portion of the Jakapa Soft Skills Questionnaire. The results of the Peer Evaluation portion will be anonymous and individual results will be kept internally for research purposes only. The results will be averaged together and sent to the instructor. The instructor may choose to send out the results of the averaged individual scores.
The Peer Evaluation portion consists of three parts, intrapersonal, interpersonal and methodological. These parts represent the subcategories of soft skills as designated by the ModEs program. The intrapersonal and interpersonal sections will have 7 attribute questions each with a follow up comment section. The methodological section will have 8 attribute questions with a follow up comment section. The attribute questions are based on the definitions provided and validated by the ModEs program. They have been modified to fit the format of the question and to more easily communicate the material.</p>
